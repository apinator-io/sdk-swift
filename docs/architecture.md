Any state ──disconnect()──> disconnected (terminal, no reconnect)
```

## Reconnection Strategy

- Exponential backoff: `min(1.0 * 2^attempt, 30.0)` seconds
- Default max attempts: 6 (configurable via `maxReconnectAttempts`)
- Reconnection resets on successful connection
- On reconnect, all existing channel subscriptions are automatically re-sent

## Channel Management

`Apinator` maintains a `[String: Channel]` dictionary of active subscriptions.

- **Subscribe**: creates a `Channel` (or `PresenceChannel` for `presence-` prefix), stores it, and sends `realtime:subscribe` if connected.
- **Reconnect**: iterates all channels and re-sends subscribe messages.
- **Unsubscribe**: sends `realtime:unsubscribe`, removes channel from dictionary, unbinds all callbacks.

## Authentication Flow

For `private-` and `presence-` channels:

1. Client calls `authEndpoint` via POST with `{ "socket_id", "channel_name" }`
2. Your server validates the user and returns `{ "auth": "key:signature", "channel_data": "..." }`
3. The SDK includes `auth` (and `channel_data` for presence) in the subscribe message
4. Server validates the HMAC signature

## Message Protocol

All WebSocket frames are JSON text:

```json
{"event": "event-name", "channel": "channel-name", "data": "json-string"}
```

- `data` is always a JSON-encoded string (double-encoded)
- System events use `realtime:` prefix
- Client events use `client-` prefix

## Activity Timeout / Keep-alive

1. Server sends `activity_timeout` in the connection established message
2. Client starts a timer for that duration
3. On timeout, client sends `realtime:ping`
4. If no `realtime:pong` within 30s, connection is closed and reconnect begins

## Design Principles

- **Zero dependencies**: uses only Foundation and URLSessionWebSocketTask
- **Chainable API**: mutating methods return `Self` with `@discardableResult`
- **Weak self captures**: closures use `[weak self]` to prevent retain cycles
- **Idempotent subscribe**: calling `subscribe()` twice returns the same channel instance
